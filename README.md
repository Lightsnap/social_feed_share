## About the package

This package is made for the Lightsnap app, but feel free to use it if you need
social sharing capabilities in your app. This package is only for sharing media 
to Instagram and Facebook. 

If you would like to add more platforms to share to feel free to fork
the app. Lightsnap is currently not planning on adding more than
Instagram or Facebook.

## TODOS
- Add better readme for setting up the Facebook SDK on Android & iOS
- Add code examples to the Readme.md
